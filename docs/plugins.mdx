# Plugins

Plugins allows you to extend **siimple** adding more styles like components, helpers or icons. You will need to import the `siimple/plugins` module in your configuration file:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;
```


## Components plugin

We provide a collection of built-in UI components that you can customize and reuse across your projects, that includes buttons, alerts, navigation links, and more!

**Components are always enabled by default**, so you do not need to import them as a plugin. In case that you do not need components in your output CSS, you can disable them using a **configuration flag**:

```scss
@use "siimple" with (
    $flags: (
        "add-components": false,
    ),
);
```

You can manually import individual components as a single plugin in the `$plugins` section of the configuration:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $flags: (
        "add-core-components": false,
    ),
    $plugins: (
        plugins.btn(),
        plugins.column(),
        plugins.text(),
    ),
);
```

## Experimental plugins

The **experimental** plugin provides additional components that in a future will be merged with the core components. Just call the `plugins.experiments` function in the `$plugins` section of your configuration to include them in your output CSS:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $plugins: (
        plugins.experiments(),
    ),
);
```

## Helpers plugin

The **helpers** plugin provides a collection of **small functional CSS classes** that can be used for creating or customizing components. The main aim of this plugin is to provide a collection of reusable classes to replace the conventional style of writting CSS classes.

To load the helpers plugin, just add the `plugins.helpers()` function in the `$plugins` section of your configuration:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $plugins: (
        plugins.helpers(),
    ),
);
```

Additionally, in case that you are only interested in some helpers you can load each helper individually instead of loading all helpers:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $plugins: (
        plugins.color(),
        plugins.spacing(),
        plugins.sizing(),
    ),
));
```


## Icons plugin

The icons plugin can be enabled just adding the `plugins.icons()` function in the `$plugins` section of your configuration:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $plugins: (
        plugins.icons(),
    ),
);
```

This will add the `siimple-icon` component to your output CSS, and will generate one variant for each icon.

### Customization

The following options can be used to customize the icons plugin:

- `path`: path to the fonts folder. By default is `./`. **The path must end with a `/`**.
- `include`: if provided, only icons in this list will be included for the output CSS.
- `exclude`: if provided, icons in this list will be excluded from the output CSS.

Example: 

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $plugins: (
        plugins.icons((
            "path": "./fonts/",
            "include": (
                "star",
                "user",
            ),
        )),
    ),
);
```

Remember to copy all fonts in the `siimple` package to your project assets folder and use the `path` option to set the path to the fonts folder.


### Using icons

Create a `<i>` tag with the following classes: 

- `siimple-icon`: is the icon component base classname. 
- `is-[ICON]`, where `[ICON]` is the name of the desired icon.

```html 
<!-- Add a left arrow icon -->
<i class="siimple-icon is-arrow-left"></i>

<!-- Add a star icon -->
<i class="siimple-icon is-star"></i>
```

You can style your icon using `font-size` and `color` style properties:

```html 
<!-- Using style attribute -->
<i class="siimple-icon is-star" style="color:#ffea66;font-size:20px;"></i>

<!-- Using helpers -->
<i class="siimple-icon is-star has-color-red-500 has-size-xl"></i>
```

> **Note**: in case that you have changed or removed the prefix using the `$prefix` section of the configuration, the component classname will be different.
