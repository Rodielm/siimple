# Theme Configuration

The `$theme` section of the **siimple** configuration is where you can define your colors, sizes, breakpoints and more.


### Breakpoints

You can customize the breakpoints used in **siimple** adding a map in the `$theme.breakpoints` section with your custom breakpoints. The keys in this map are the breakpoints names, and the value can be one of the following:

- A screen size in `px`, that will be set as the `min-width` value.
- A map with the values for `min-width` and `max-width`. For example, `("min": 0px, "max": 600px)` will generate `@media screen and (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 600px)`.

This is the default breakpoints configuration: 

```scss
@use "siimple" with (
    $theme: (
        "breakpoints": (
            "mobile": ("min": 0px, "max": 600px),
            "tablet": ("min": 600px),
            "desktop": ("min": 1200px),
            "fullhd": ("min": 1800px),
        ),
    ),
);
```
