# Packages

In addition with the original `siimple` package, we maintain the following packages used in the **siimple** ecosystem:

- [`@siimple/core`](/packages/core): the core and agnostic engine of **siimple**, that you can use for building your own CSS framework.
- [`@siimple/colors`](/packages/colors): our color palette.
- [`@siimple/preset-base`](/packages/base): our default theme primitives, that includes colors, fonts, sizes and spaces.
