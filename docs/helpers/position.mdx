# Position

Use the following classes to set the position of an element:

| Class | Property | 
|-------|----------|
| `has-position-initial` | `position: initial;` |
| `has-position-relative` | `position: relative;` |
| `has-position-absolute` | `position: absolute;` |
| `has-position-sticky` | `position: sticky;` |
| `has-position-fixed` | `position: fixed;` |


### Responsive position

Control the position of an element at a specific breakpoint adding a `{breakpoint}:` prefix to the position or placement class helper.

```html
<div class="mobile:has-position-fixed mobile:has-top-0">
    . . .
</div>
```

### Disabling position helpers

If you do not need the position helpers in your project, you can disable them by adding to the `exclude` list in the `helpers` plugin configuration:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $plugins: (
        plugins.helpers((
            "exclude": (
                "position",
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```
