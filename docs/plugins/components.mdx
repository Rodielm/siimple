# Components Plugin

We provide a collection of built-in UI components that you can customize and reuse across your projects. We have divided our components collection into two groups: 

- **Core components**: primary and most common used components, that includes alerts, buttons, navigation links, and more!
- **Experimental components**: additional components that will be merged in a future with the core components.

**Components are always enabled by default**, so you do not need to import them as a plugin. In case that you do not need components in your output CSS, you can disable them using a **configuration flag**:

```scss
@use "siimple" with (
    $flags: (
        "add-core-components": false,  // Skip core components
        "add-experimental-components": false, // Skip experimental components 
    ),
);
```

Also, in case that you only need some components in your output CSS, you can import each component as a single plugin in the `$plugins` section of the configuration. Remember that you must import the `siimple/plugins` module for adding plugins to the configuration:

```scss
@use "siimple/plugins" as plugins;

@use "siimple" with (
    $flags: (
        "add-core-components": false,
        "add-experimental-components": false,
    ),
    $plugins: (
        plugins.btn(),
        plugins.column(),
        plugins.text(),
    ),
);
```
