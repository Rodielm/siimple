# Naming methodology

The **siimple** toolkit uses a simplified version of the [**SMACSS** methodology](http://smacss.com) for naming classnames, as described on this section. We have divided the classnames used in **siimple** into three blocks:

- **Components**: are the primary building blocks of **siimple**.
- **State modifiers**: used to change the state of each component.
- **Helper modifiers**: low-level classnames that can be applied to any element.
 

### Components 

We use the following syntax for naming **components** in siimple:

```
.siimple-<ComponentName>[-<ChildName>]
```

#### Namespace

Each single component has been prefixed with the `siimple-` namespace. Adding a namespace to your classnames is always a good choice, because it prevents collisions between library styles and your custom styles.


#### ComponentName

We always use a single workd as a component name. For example, buttons have `btn` as the component name:

```html
<button class="siimple-btn">Button</button>
```

#### ChildName

Used to name another component that is a descendant of the primary component. For example, a `siimple-nav` component always come with a collection of navigation items, named with the classname `siimple-nav-item`:

```html
<div class="siimple-nav">
    <a href="#" class="siimple-nav-item">Navigation item 1</a>
    <a href="#" class="siimple-nav-item">Navigation item 2</a>
    <a href="#" class="siimple-nav-item">Navigation item 3</a>
</div>
```


### State modifiers

**State modifiers** are special classnames used to change the state of a component. State modifiers always use the following syntax:

```
.is-<StateValue>
```

The following example shows how to change the default state of the button component to make it full-width and with the primary color:

```html
<button class="siimple-btn is-primary is-full">Primary button</button>
```

Every single component must define its own states, and some state modifiers that works for some components may not be available for another components. This means that `is-primary` modifier can be applied for example to a `siimple-btn` component, but has no effect when applied to `siimple-card`.


### Helpers modifiers

**Helpers modifiers** are a collection of low-level classnames that can be used in any element to modify some CSS properties. These modifiers follows this syntax:

```
.has-<HelperValue>
```

Helpers modifiers are available as part of the **colors** and **helpers** plugins.



### Conditional states and helpers


#### Responsive modifiers

Some state and helpers modifiers can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, for building adaptative and responsive interfaces. 

```
.<BreakpointValue>:is-<StateValue>
.<BreakpointValue>:has-<HelperValue>
```

Take a look at the <Link to="/concepts/responsive" className="siimple-link">Responsive</Link> guide to learn more about the breakpoint values defined on **siimple**.


#### Status modifiers

Similar to responsive modifiers, you can apply some helpers only in response to an specific status of the element. 

##### Hover status

Add the `hover:` prefix to a helper class to apply it only on hover. Only **text** and **background** helpers have enabled this status modifier.

```html live=true align=center
<div class="siimple-btn has-text-white has-bg-purple-500 hover:has-bg-purple-700">
    Hoverable button
</div>
```
